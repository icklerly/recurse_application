# An example application for Bayesian Inference
Assume you have m different colored Lego models and they have only the white colored bricks in common. You also know that each model can contain k white bricks.
Therefore you may have a minimum of 0 and a maximum of l*k+1 white bricks in total.
Given a random weight matrix [m][k+1] what is the most probable number of white bricks?
